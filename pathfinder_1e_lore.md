# Pathfinder 1st Edition: Golarion

## The World of Golarion: A Land of Ancient Mysteries

Welcome to Golarion, a world where the divine walks among mortals and ancient empires lie buried beneath the sands of time. This is a realm where magic flows as freely as the rivers, where gods answer prayers with miracles and curses, and where every crumbling ruin holds the promise of untold treasures and terrible dangers. Golarion is not merely a setting—it is a living, breathing world where your actions can reshape the course of history.

At the heart of Golarion's cosmology stands the Starstone, a massive meteorite that crashed into the world thousands of years ago. This celestial artifact serves as the divine test for mortal ascension—those who can reach the Starstone and survive its trials may become gods themselves. It was through this trial that Aroden, the god of humanity, achieved divinity, and it was his mysterious death that plunged the world into the Age of Lost Omens, a time of uncertainty and change.

## The Pantheon: Gods of Light and Shadow

Golarion's pantheon is as diverse as the world itself, with deities representing every aspect of mortal existence. Abadar, the Master of the First Vault, watches over civilization, commerce, and law, while Calistria, the Savored Sting, embodies revenge, lust, and trickery. Iomedae, the Inheritor, carries the torch of Aroden's legacy as the goddess of justice and valor, while Pharasma, the Lady of Graves, judges the souls of the dead.

But not all gods serve the light. Lamashtu, the Mother of Monsters, spreads corruption and deformity, while Zon-Kuthon, the Midnight Lord, revels in pain and darkness. Rovagug, the Rough Beast, lies imprisoned beneath the world, his destructive power contained by the combined might of the other deities. The constant struggle between these divine forces shapes the fate of mortals and nations alike.

## Ancient Civilizations and Lost Secrets

Golarion's history stretches back millennia, with countless civilizations rising and falling like the tides. The Azlanti Empire, humanity's first great civilization, achieved heights of magic and technology that modern scholars can barely comprehend. Their fall came during Earthfall, when a massive asteroid struck the world, creating the Inner Sea and plunging the world into darkness.

The Thassilonian Empire, ruled by the Runelords of Sin, built massive monuments and developed powerful magic before their own corruption destroyed them. The Jistka Imperium, the Osiriani Pharaohs, and the ancient Varisian tribes all left their mark on the world, their ruins now scattered across the landscape like broken dreams.

These ancient sites hold more than just treasure—they contain knowledge, artifacts, and secrets that could change the course of history. But they are also home to the descendants of those who came before: the serpentfolk of ancient Azlant, the cyclopes of Thassilon, and countless other creatures that have adapted to survive in the ruins of their ancestors' glory.

## Magic: The Lifeblood of Golarion

Magic in Golarion is not merely a tool—it is a fundamental force that shapes reality itself. Arcane magic draws power from the stars and the elements, while divine magic flows from the gods and their domains. Primal magic connects mortals to the natural world, and psychic magic taps into the power of the mind and soul.

The world is crisscrossed with ley lines, invisible currents of magical energy that flow like rivers of power. Ancient monuments, standing stones, and natural formations often mark these ley lines, and those who know how to tap into them can perform feats of magic beyond the capabilities of ordinary spellcasters.

But magic comes with a price. The use of powerful magic can attract the attention of extraplanar entities, corrupt the user's soul, or even tear holes in reality itself. The Worldwound, a massive rift to the Abyss in the north, stands as a constant reminder of what happens when magic goes wrong.

## Current Tensions and Political Intrigue

Golarion is a world in flux, with old powers fading and new ones rising to take their place. The nation of Cheliax, once the greatest human empire, now serves as a vassal to the archdevil Asmodeus, its people living under the rule of diabolical nobility. The city-state of Absalom, built around the Starstone, serves as a neutral ground where representatives of every nation and faith gather to trade, negotiate, and scheme.

In the north, the barbarian tribes of the Lands of the Linnorm Kings raid and trade with their southern neighbors, while the mysterious nation of Irrisen remains locked in eternal winter under the rule of the White Witches. The Mwangi Expanse hides ancient ruins and powerful artifacts, while the deserts of Osirion conceal the tombs of pharaohs and the secrets of the past.

Every nation has its own agenda, every faction its own goals. The Pathfinder Society, an organization of explorers and scholars, seeks to uncover the world's secrets while maintaining neutrality in political conflicts. The Aspis Consortium, their rivals, pursues profit above all else, while the Red Mantis assassins serve their own mysterious masters.

## Adventure Awaits

In Golarion, every road leads to adventure. Whether you're exploring the haunted crypts of Ustalav, navigating the political intrigues of Taldor, or braving the monster-infested wilderness of the River Kingdoms, there's always something new to discover. Ancient dungeons wait to be explored, lost cities beg to be found, and forgotten treasures call out to those brave enough to seek them.

The world is alive with possibility, and your choices matter. Will you serve the gods or defy them? Will you preserve ancient knowledge or destroy it? Will you build a new empire or tear down the old ones? In Golarion, the fate of the world is in your hands, and every decision you make ripples through the fabric of reality itself.

Welcome to Golarion, traveler. Your destiny awaits.
