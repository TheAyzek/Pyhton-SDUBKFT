# Cyberpunk RED: Night City

## The World After the Fourth Corporate War

Welcome to Night City, a neon-lit hellscape where the American Dream died and was reborn as a corporate nightmare. The year is 2045, and the world is still reeling from the Fourth Corporate War—a conflict that didn't just change the geopolitical landscape; it shattered it completely. Governments collapsed, corporations became the new superpowers, and the line between human and machine blurred beyond recognition. This is the Time of the Red, an era of chaos, opportunity, and survival.

The Fourth Corporate War ended with the destruction of the old net, the global information network that connected the world. In its place rose the new net, a fractured, dangerous system where data flows like blood through cybernetic veins. The old world order is dead, replaced by a patchwork of corporate territories, free cities, and lawless zones where the strong prey on the weak and the clever prey on the strong.

## Night City: The City of Dreams and Nightmares

Night City stands as a monument to human ambition and folly, a sprawling metropolis where skyscrapers pierce the smog-choked sky and the streets pulse with the rhythm of a million lives lived on the edge. This is a city of contrasts—where corporate executives live in luxury penthouses while street kids fight for survival in the Combat Zone, where cutting-edge technology exists alongside medieval levels of poverty and violence.

The city is divided into districts, each with its own character and dangers. The Corporate Center gleams with chrome and glass, home to the headquarters of the world's most powerful corporations. Pacifica offers a glimpse of the old world's luxury, while the Combat Zone is a war zone where gangs fight for territory and survival. The Badlands stretch beyond the city limits, a lawless frontier where nomads roam and corporate interests clash.

## The New Corporate Order

The corporations emerged from the Fourth Corporate War as the world's true powers. Arasaka, Militech, Biotechnica, and the other megacorps don't just control markets—they control governments, armies, and the very fabric of society. These corporations are more than businesses; they are nations unto themselves, with their own laws, their own armies, and their own agendas.

But corporate power comes with corporate warfare. The megacorps constantly jockey for position, using everything from economic pressure to corporate espionage to outright military force to gain advantage. The corporate wars may be officially over, but the conflict continues in boardrooms, on the streets, and in the digital realm. And caught in the middle are the people of Night City, pawns in a game they can barely understand.

## Netrunners: Digital Ghosts in the Machine

The new net is a dangerous place, a digital frontier where data is currency and information is power. Netrunners are the digital cowboys of this new frontier, using their cyberdecks to navigate the complex web of corporate networks, government systems, and underground data fortresses. They are hackers, spies, and thieves, operating in a world where the line between the real and the virtual has all but disappeared.

But the net is also a battlefield. Corporate ICE (Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics) protects valuable data with deadly force, while rival netrunners compete for the same targets. The old net may be gone, but the new net is just as dangerous, with rogue AIs, digital viruses, and corporate security systems that can fry a runner's brain as easily as they can protect their data.

## Edge Runners: Living on the Edge

Edge runners are the heroes and villains of Night City, men and women who live by their wits, their skills, and their willingness to do whatever it takes to survive. They are mercenaries, fixers, and criminals, operating in the shadows where the law doesn't reach and the corporations don't care. They are the ones who get things done, whether those things are legal, illegal, or somewhere in between.

But being an edge runner is more than just a job—it's a way of life. It means living on the edge of society, always one step ahead of the law and one step behind the next big score. It means making deals with devils and hoping you can outsmart them. It means knowing that every job could be your last, and that the only thing standing between you and oblivion is your skills, your luck, and your chrome.

## The Street Life: Grit and Glamour

Life on the streets of Night City is a constant struggle for survival. Gangs control territory with violence and intimidation, while fixers broker deals between the various factions that make up the city's underworld. The police are either corrupt, overwhelmed, or both, leaving the streets to be policed by private security forces and corporate enforcers.

But the streets are also where the city's culture thrives. Street fashion is a form of rebellion, with people using their appearance to express their identity and their defiance. Street music fills the air, from the aggressive sounds of rockerboys to the electronic beats of synthwave. And street food feeds the masses, with vendors serving everything from synthetic protein to real meat at prices that most people can afford.

## Technology and Humanity

Technology has transformed what it means to be human in Night City. Cybernetic implants are as common as tattoos, with people replacing their natural parts with artificial ones for function, fashion, or both. Neural interfaces allow direct connection to the net, while cyberdecks turn the human brain into a computer terminal. But this technology comes with a price—cyberpsychosis, the mental breakdown that can occur when too much of the human mind is replaced by machine.

The line between human and machine is constantly shifting, with some people choosing to become more machine than human in their quest for power or survival. But others fight to maintain their humanity, seeing the encroachment of technology as a threat to what makes them human. This tension between human and machine, between natural and artificial, is at the heart of life in Night City.

## The Future is Now

Night City is a warning and a promise, a vision of what the future might become if we're not careful. It's a world where corporations have more power than governments, where technology has transformed what it means to be human, and where the only law that matters is the law of the jungle. But it's also a world of opportunity, where a street kid can become a legend, where a netrunner can change the world from behind a keyboard, and where an edge runner can make their own destiny.

This is the world of Cyberpunk RED, where the future is now, and the only question is whether you'll survive it or become another casualty of the Time of the Red.
